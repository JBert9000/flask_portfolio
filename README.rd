Here is my portfolio website I made using Flask as my backend. There are some interactive parts to this site including a blog where users can sign up and comment, as well as a javascript based Tetris game, to a downloads section. My goal is to show off what I am learning as well as make my page fun for anyone who visits.

This app is deployed on Heroku at the moment, and is using Postgres as the database. More features will come as I am able to implement them.
