This is my Flask based portfolio website.

There are some interactive parts to this site including a blog where users can sign up and comment, a javascript based Tetris game, as well as a downloads section. My goal is to show off what I am learning as well as make my page fun for anyone who visits.

This app is deployed on Heroku at the moment, and is using Postgres as the database. More features will come as I am able to implement them.


I have followed a few tutorials to get this working;

1. Corey Schafer - Python Flask Tutorial: Full-Featured Webb App Series
  - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH for the blog portion of my site.

    * This part was a review in some ways since I worked with something very similar in Ruby on Rails in the past. I wanted to see how to get a backend database working with Postgres as well as have users interact with my site. I have learned a lot through these videos. My next step will be to follow the Django tutorial which will build the same site. This way, I can have an idea of how both Flask and Django work as a backend framework / module.

2. Meth Meth Method - Write a Tetris game in Javascript
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA for the Tetris game.

    * I must admit at the time of writing this, this tutorial was advanced for me. But I wanted to get an idea of the logic behind how to make a Tetris game in JS and implement it into my site. It is also a refresher for me in regards to Javascript and the style / syntax of the language.

3. Ardit Sulce - The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications
  - https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/ for the stock charts and getting started

    * Before making this site, I followed the tutorials from this course to dive into Python and what is possible to do with the language. I implemented the stock charts from one of the parts of this course, and added it to my site. I made the charts first in Jupyter Notebook and added them afterwards.
